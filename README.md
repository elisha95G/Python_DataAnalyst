Diabetic Predictive
📊 Title: Predictive Modelling for Diabetes Diagnosis 📈

Objective 💡: The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to enhance the accuracy of diabetes prediction. 📊✨

Tools ⚙️: Jupyter Notebook 🐍

Step-by-Step Guide on EDA 🔍:
📌 Step 1: Data Collection and Loading: Collected a dataset containing information about diabetes patients, including variables like age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and family history.

📌 Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately. Removed duplicates to ensure data integrity.

📌 Step 3: Descriptive Statistics: Used summary statistics to understand the data, including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. Analyzed the distribution of numerical variables through various plots.

📌 Step 4: Visualization: Created visualizations to explore variable relationships:
Box plots to identify potential outliers.
Pair plots to visualize interactions between variables.
Heatmaps to understand correlations between variables.

📌 Step 5: Outlier Detection: Identified outliers using box plot techniques to refine the dataset.

📌 Step 6: Prediction: Made predictions based on insights and findings 🌟.

Model Performance Accuracy:
Logistic Regression: 76%
Decision Tree: 68%
Random Forest: 71%
Naive Bayes: 74%
These results are not only valuable for improving diabetes prediction but also provide insights into which diagnostic measurements are most significant for early detection.
